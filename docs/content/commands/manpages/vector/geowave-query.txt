==== NAME

geowave-vector-query - Query vector data using GeoWave Query Language

[[vector-query-synopsis]]
==== SYNOPSIS

  geowave vector query [options] <query>

[[vector-query-description]]
==== DESCRIPTION

This command queries vector data using an SQL-like syntax.  The query language currently only supports `SELECT` and `DELETE` statements.

The syntax for `SELECT` statements is as follows:

  SELECT <attributes> FROM <storeName>.<typeName> [ WHERE CQL(<cqlFilter>) ]
  
Where `<attributes>` is a comma-separated list of column selectors or aggregation functions, `<storeName>` is the data store name, `<typeName>` is the type name, and `<cqlFilter>` is a CQL filter to filter the results by.

The syntax for `DELETE` statements is as follows:

  DELETE FROM <storeName>.<typeName> [ WHERE CQL(<cqlFilter>) ]
  
Where `<storeName>` is the data store name, `<typeName>` is the type name, and `<cqlFilter>` is the filter to delete results by.

==== OPTIONS

*--debug*::
  If specified, print out additional info for debug purposes.
  
*-f, --format* _<format>_::
  Output format for query results.  Possible values are `console`, `csv`, `shp`, and `geojson`.  Both `shp` and `geojson` formats require that the query results contain at least 1 geometry column.  Default is `console`.
  
When the `csv` format is used, additional options are:

*$$*$$ -o, --outputFile* _<file>_::
  CSV file to output query results to.
  
When the `shp` format is used, additional options are:

*$$*$$ -o, --outputFile* _<file>_::
  Shapefile to output query results to.
  
*-t, --typeName* _<name>_::
  Output feature type name.
  
When the `geojson` format is used, additional options are:

*$$*$$ -o, --outputFile* _<file>_::
  GeoJson file to output query results to.
  
*-t, --typeName* _<name>_::
  Output feature type name.
  
[[vector-query-examples]]
==== EXAMPLES

Calculate the total population of countries that intersect a bounding box that covers a region of Europe:

  geowave vector query "SELECT SUM(population) FROM example.countries WHERE CQL(BBOX(geom, 7, 46, 23, 51))"
  
Select only countries that have a population over 100 million:

  geowave vector query "SELECT * FROM example.countries WHERE CQL(population>100000000)"
  
Output country names and populations to a CSV file:

  geowave vector query -f csv -o myfile.csv "SELECT name, population FROM example.countries"
