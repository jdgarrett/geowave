2.1+| 3.1+| index            | GeoWave Index                         | Focused on the problem of maintaining good lexicographic sort order for multi-dimensional data, exposed primarily through {core-index}/core/index/NumericIndexStrategy.java[`NumericIndexStrategy`], i.e., how is the key formed for the key/value store.

1.1+| 4.1+| examples         | GeoWave Examples                      | Some very basic code examples for reading and writing vector data in GeoWave, and running some basic analytics. This is a great and simple place to contribute if you see a gap that you think should be covered.

1.1+| 4.1+| extensions       | GeoWave Extensions                    | The set of extended capabilities supported for GeoWave
2.1+| 3.1+| adapters         | GeoWave Extension Adapaters           | A {core-store}/core/store/api/DataTypeAdapter.java[`DataTypeAdapter`] in the system is essentially responsible for taking any java object and handling serialization/deserialization to/from the value portion of the key/value pair. It's called _encode_ and _decode_ in the code because it is a little more complex than just _serialization_ and _deserialization_, but in general, the over-simplified high-level view is that the {core-index}/core/index/NumericIndexStrategy.java[`NumericIndexStrategy`] from `geowave-core-index` handles building a good key, and the {core-store}/core/store/api/DataTypeAdapter.java[`DataTypeAdapter`] handles building a good value, then the {core-store}/core/store/api/DataStore.java[`DataStore`] has no direct logic for mapping the java object to a key or a value. If you have a new java object, you can write a new adapter independent of specific data stores. Likewise, if you have a new strategy for indexing or a different dimensionality to index, that would be independent of any of the specific data stores (ie. you can simply write your own adapter if you have a unique dataset and it can store your data with any indexing scheme on any backend data store).
