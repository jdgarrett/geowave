== Standalone Installers
In order to make installation of the GeoWave Command-Line Interface (CLI) as simple as possible, installers are provided for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

* link:https://geowave.s3.amazonaws.com/${version_url}/standalone-installers/geowave_macos_${tag.version}.dmg[Mac]

These installers allow you to customize your GeoWave installation by including or excluding support for various utilities, data stores, third party services, analytics, and ingest formats.  If you aren't sure which of these to include in your installation, we recommend keeping them all to avoid any confusion later on.

Once the installation has been completed, verify that the GeoWave CLI has been installed by opening up a new terminal or command prompt and issuing the `geowave help` command:
