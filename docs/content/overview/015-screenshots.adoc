== Example Screenshots

The screenshots below are of data loaded from various attributed data sets into a GeoWave instance, processed
(in some cases) by a GeoWave analytic process, and rendered by GeoServer.

=== GeoLife

Microsoft research has made available a trajectory data set that contains the GPS coordinates of 182 users over a three year period (April 2007 to August 2012). There are 17,621 trajectories in this data set.

More information on this data set is available at link:https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/geolife-building-social-networks-using-human-location-history/[Microsoft Research GeoLife page^, window="_blank"].

=== OpenStreetMap GPX Tracks

The OpenStreetMap Foundation has released a large set of user contributed GPS tracks. These are about eight years of historical tracks. The data set consists of just under three billion (not trillion as some websites claim) points, or just under one million trajectories.

More information on this data set is available at link:http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.gpx[GPX Planet page^, window="_blank"].

=== T-Drive

Microsoft research has made available a trajectory data set that contains the GPS coordinates of 10,357 taxis in Beijing, China and surrounding areas over  a one week period. There are approximately 15 million points in this data set.

More information on this data set is available at: link:http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/?id=152883[Microsoft Research T-drive page^, window="_blank"].

==== T-Drive at City Scale

Below are renderings of the t-drive data. They display the raw points along with the results of a GeoWave kernel density analytic. The data corresponds to Mapbox zoom level 12.
