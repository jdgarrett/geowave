= GeoWave EMR Quickstart Guide

The GeoWave EMR Quickstart guide is similar to the link:quickstart.html[standard Quickstart Guide, window="_blank"], except that it is run in an AWS EMR environment. There are also Jupyter and Zeppelin Notebook examples for users looking try out GeoWave in that manner.
