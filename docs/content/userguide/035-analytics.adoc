=== Overview

Analytics embody algorithms tailored to geospatial data.  Most analytics leverage either Hadoop MapReduce or Spark for bulk computation.  Results of analytic jobs consist of vector or raster data stored in GeoWave.

GeoWave provides the following algorithms out of the box.

[width="100%",cols="2,10",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Name |Description
|KMeans++| A K-means implementation to find K centroids over the population of data. A set of preliminary sampling iterations find an optimal value of K and the initial set of K centroids. The algorithm produces K centroids and their associated polygons.  Each polygon represents the concave hull containing all features associated with a centroid. The algorithm supports drilling down multiple levels. At each level, the set centroids are determined from the set of features associated the same centroid from the previous level.
|KMeans Jump| Uses KMeans++ over a range of K, choosing an optimal K using an information theoretic based measurement.
|KMeans Parallel| A K-means implementation that is performed in parallel.
|KMeans Spark| A K-means implementation that is performed with Spark ML.
|KDE| A Kernel Density Estimation implementation that produces a density raster from input vector data.
|KDE Spark| Executes the KDE implementation using Apache Spark.
|DBScan| The Density Based Scanner algorithm produces a set of convex polygons for each region meeting density criteria. Density of region is measured by a minimum cardinality of enclosed features within a specified distance from each other.
|Nearest Neighbors| An infrastructure component that produces all the neighbors of a feature within a specific distance.
