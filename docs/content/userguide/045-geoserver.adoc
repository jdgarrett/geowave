== GeoServer Plugin

This section will outline the various capabilities of the GeoWave GeoServer plugin. While GeoServer is a third-party tool that integrates with GeoWave, it is important to note that this is not meant to be an exhaustive guide to GeoServer, though it's more of an overview and integration guide. For official GeoServer documentation and how-to guides, please reference the link:http://docs.geoserver.org[GeoServer documentation, window="_blank"] guides.

GeoWave supports both raster images and vector data exposed through GeoServer.

=== Installation

There are two ways to obtain the GeoWave GeoServer plugin JAR, the first is to simply download it from the Release JARs section of the link:packages.html[packages] page.  The second is to link:devguide.html#geoserver-plugin[package the JAR from the GeoWave source^, window="_blank"].

The GeoWave GeoServer plugin can be installed by simply dropping the plugin JAR into the `WEB-INF/lib` directory of GeoServer's installation and then restarting the web service.

=== Data Sources

GeoWave data stores are supported by GeoServer through the GeoTools DataStore API. After installing the GeoWave plugin on a GeoServer instance, GeoWave data stores can be configured through the GeoServer web interface by clicking on the `Stores` link under the `Data` section of the navigation bar.

When adding a new GeoWave store, several configuration options are available, depending on the type of store being added.  For options that are not required, suitable defaults are provided by GeoWave if a value is not supplied. The options available for each store are detailed below.

==== Common Configuration Options

These options are available for all data store types.

=== GeoServer CLI Configuration

GeoWave can be configured for a GeoServer connection through the link:commands.html#config-geoserver[`config geoserver`] command.

[source, bash]
----
$ geowave config geoserver <geoserver_url> --user <username> --pass <password>
----

[frame="topbot", width="100%", cols="15%,10%,75%", grid="rows", options="header"]
|==========================
| Argument    | Required | Description
| --url       | True     | GeoServer URL (for example http://localhost:8080/geoserver), or simply host:port and appropriate assumptions are made
| --username  | True     | GeoServer User
| --password  | True     | GeoServer Password - Refer to the <<115-appendix-security.adoc#password-security, password security>> section for more details and options
| --workspace | False    | GeoServer Default Workspace
|==========================

GeoWave supports connecting to GeoServer through both HTTP and HTTPS (HTTP + SSL) connections. If connecting to GeoServer through an HTTP connection (e.g., http://localhost:8080/geoserver), the command above is sufficient.

==== GeoServer SSL Connection Properties
If connecting to GeoServer through a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection over HTTPS (e.g., https://localhost:8443/geoserver), some additional configuration options need to be specified, in order for the system to properly establish the secure connection’s SSL parameters. Depending on the particular SSL configuration through which the GeoServer server is being connected, you will need to specify which parameters are necessary.

[NOTE]
====
Not all SSL configuration settings may be necessary, as it depends on the setup of the SSL connection through which GeoServer is hosted. Contact your GeoServer administrator for SSL connection related details.

|==========================

=== WFS-T

Transactions are initiated through a Transaction operation, that contains inserts, updates, and deletes to features. WFS-T supports feature locks across multiple requests by using a lock request followed by subsequent use of a provided _Lock ID_. The GeoWave implementation supports transaction isolation. Consistency during a commit is not fully supported. Thus, a failure during a commit of a transaction may leave the affected data in an intermediary state. Some deletions, updates, or insertions may not be processed in such a case. The client application must implement its own compensation logic upon receiving a commit-time error response. As expected with Accumulo, operations on a single feature instances are atomic.

Inserted features are buffered prior to commit. The features are bulk fed to the data store when the buffer size is exceeded and when the transaction is committed. In support of atomicity and isolation, flushed features, prior to commit, are marked in a transient state and are only visible to the controlling transaction. Upon commit, these features are 'unmarked'. The overhead incurred by this operation is avoided by increasing the buffer size to avoid pre-commit flushes.

==== Lock Management

Lock management supports life-limited locks on feature instances. The only supported lock manager is in-memory, which is suitable for single Geoserver instance installations.

==== Index Selection

Data written through WFS-T is indexed within a single index. When writing data, the adapter inspects existing indices and finds the index that best matches the input data. A spatial-temporal index is chosen for features with temporal attributes. If no suitable index can be found, a spatial index will be created. A spatial-temporal index will not be automatically created, even if the feature type contains a temporal attribute as spatial-temporal indices can have reduced performance on queries requesting data over large spans of time.

=== Security

==== Authorization Management

Authorization Management determines the set of authorizations to supply to GeoWave queries to be compared against the <<040-visibility-management.adoc#visibility-management, visibility expressions>> attached to GeoWave data.

The provided implementations include the following:

* Empty - Each request is processed without additional authorization.
* JSON - The requester user name, extracted from the Security Context, is used as a key to find the user's set of authorizations from a JSON file. The location of the JSON file is determined by the associated _Authorization Data URL_ (e.g., _/opt/config/auth.json_). An example of the contents of the JSON file is given below.

[source, json]
----
{
  "authorizationSet": {
     "fred" : ["1","2","3"],
     "barney" : ["a"]
  }
}
----

In this example, the user `fred` has three authorization labels. The user `barney` has just one.

NOTE: Additional authorization management strategies can be registered through the Java Service Provider Interface (SPI) model by implementing the {adapter-auth}/adapter/auth/AuthorizationFactorySPI.java[`AuthorizationFactorySPI`] interface. For more information on using SPI, see the link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/SPI-intro.html[Oracle documentation, window="_blank"].
